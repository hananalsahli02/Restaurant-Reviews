__Map API:__

- [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/). I've decided to use Google Maps' key instead of MapBox cause I just like the layout :)

__ServiceWoker:__
43
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers). This resource in particular helped me to set up correctly the ServiceWorker.
